# Mass Spectrometry data

## This folder contains the proteomic data for the project.

Raw data can be found under the PRIDE accession number PXD046067 (reviewers only, public soon).
- The countData in this folder is corrected for batch effect (using HarmonizR) and log2 transformed:
  * Raw Data_Harmonized.xlsx
  * Sample_annotation.xlsx is the matching metaData

- The output of the CLUEGO analysis ("house keeping proteins") is stored in
  * ClueGOResultTable.xlsx
 
- DEP analyses yielded these differentially detected proteins:
  * DEPs.xlsx
- The output of the STRING analysis (DEPs from E14 to P7) is stored in
  * STRING_DEP_AgeE14P7.xlsx
