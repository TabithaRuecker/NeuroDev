## In this folder, metaData for the RNA-seq analyses are stored.

 Raw countData are not available yet.

- Once GEO has confirmed the application and provided an accession number, it will be published here.
- In the meantime, you can contact Tabithe Ruecker to provide the raw data: ruecker.t.m@web.de
- MetaData for the RNA-seq countData is stored in the MetaData folder of this repository.

- For the DEG analyses focused on the "special" population, the following outputs were created:
  * ConsecutiveAnalysis_special.xlsx
  * MulticomparisonAnalysis_special.xlsx
 
- For the DEG analyses on both "ctrl" and "special" population, the following outputs were created:
  * with enhanced Age contrast:
  * * E14toP7_PopulationAge_redPopulation.xlsx
  * with enhanced Cell Population contrast:
  * * E14toP7_AgePopulation_redAge.xlsx

- For analyses around the birth time point (E19):
  * Birth_DEGs.xlsx
   
- For the DEG analyses with WGCNA (Treatment-based contrast):
  * MIA_DEGs.xlsx
